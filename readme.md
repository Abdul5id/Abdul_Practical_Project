## Initial Design and Specification
My original idea was to create a e-commerce website where you can purchase shoes, I started developing this and then realised the way I am creating this doesn’t suit the marking specs required as I was creating in desktop view, but it had to be responsive over several platforms. To try make it responsive led to everything going pear shaped, so I decided to start again using a template from Dave’s github and make a profile on me, but as I done this I wasn’t to keen and some areas were not responsive well enough. Finally I decided another web design which I stuck with throughout till the end, it still is a profile on me but responsive with css and JavaScript used along with apis.

## Development Process
As mentioned in my specification I came across several issues in my earlier designs mainly to do with responsiveness. Once I started on my actual website. I had several errors accross the way some being the brackets missing, code that was used from a third party was incorrectly copied. When using the code from blackboard, there was some amendments needed to make it suitable to my wesbite which I done. I have used javascript, css as required within my wesbsite and also used 2 APIs. 

One issue I had when commiting my work to github, for some reason my stylesheet naming would change to a capital S, so I have to rename it in the index.html link so it works.

Sitemap - I have included this but due to my website being different to what I have done previously, I found it difficult to do as the website I have developed is a onepage website with radio button tags. After several attamepts of trying and researching I wasnt able to do so.

## Navigation Used

When creating a website it is advised to use some form of a navigation model to guide users through the website, after being introduced to various navigation models over my study time such as hybrid, linear, Hierarchical and full web. After reading the advantages and disadvantages of the different models I feel it is best to use full web navigation which is commonly used and this model allows each page to be linked from each other and the home page and it is fully functional. Though there is a risk of getting lost, it will be very rare in my case as I plan to have a simple, easy look of page which is not cluttered and easily shown of where to navigate to and from also my website will be a simple one page website with some content on each tab, nothing extreme with too much. 


## Validation (HTML, CSS, JS)
I have come accross a few errors on each and have tried my level best and overcome many of them.

# Api Used
Within my website I have used 2 apis, one is the wikipedia search and the second is the google maps, there is an issue with the google maps. When you view the page that has the google api for the first time, it sometimes does'nt work and you need to refresh it once or twice to make sure it works.
