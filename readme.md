##Initial Design and Specification
My original idea was to create a e-commerce website where you can purchase shoes, I started developing this and then realised the way I am creating this doesn’t suit the marking specs required as I was creating in desktop view, but it had to be responsive over several platforms. To try make it responsive led to everything going pear shaped, so I decided to start again using a template from Dave’s github and make a profile on me, but as I done this I wasn’t to keen and some areas were not responsive well enough. Finally I decided another web design which I stuck with throughout till the end, it still is a profile on me but responsive with css and JavaScript used along with apis.

##Development Process
As mentioned in my specification I came across several issues in my earlier designs mainly to do with responsiveness.
