## Initial Design and Specification
My original idea was to create a e-commerce website where you can purchase shoes, I started developing this and then realised the way I am creating this doesn’t suit the marking specs required as I was creating in desktop view, but it had to be responsive over several platforms. To try make it responsive led to everything going pear shaped, so I decided to start again using a template from Dave’s github and make a profile on me, but as I done this I wasn’t to keen and some areas were not responsive well enough. Finally I decided another web design which I stuck with throughout till the end, it still is a profile on me but responsive with css and JavaScript used along with apis.

## Development Process
As mentioned in my specification I came across several issues in my earlier designs mainly to do with responsiveness. Once I started on my actual website. I had several errors accross the way some being the brackets missing, code that was used from a third party was incorrectly copied. When using the code from blackboard, there was some amendments needed to make it suitable to my wesbite which I done. I have used javascript, css as required within my wesbsite and also used 2 APIs.

## Validation (HTML, CSS, JS)


## Paper Designs

## Api Used
Within my website I have used 2 apis, one is the wikipedia search and the second is the google maps, there is an issue with the google maps. When you view the page that has the google api for the first time, it sometimes does'nt work and you need to refresh it once or twice to make sure it works.
